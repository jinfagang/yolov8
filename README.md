# YOLOv8 Deploy

Contains YOLOv8 inference in TensorRT && ONNXRuntime in C++.

This time, I want try something different, Not just inference YOLOv8 in C++, but also try building a Detection application in Rust.


Stay tuned.


PS: Some dogs please stop raise issues on my github, otherwise I will continue expose all your information. Please repect each other, thank u!


## Rust Binding Resources

1. Rust for TensorRT: https://github.com/mstallmo/tensorrt-rs, this seems not maintained.
2. Rust for ONNXRuntime
